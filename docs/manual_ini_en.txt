## How to write the configuration file

The configuration file has one setting per line,
and each line is written in the following format.

```
SettingName = SettingValue
```

All whitespace before and after the setting name and setting value is ignored.

These settings are further managed separately by section.
A line enclosed by "[" and "]" indicates the start of a section.

This is the same format as INI files used on Windows.
Therefore, any characters after ";" are treated as comments.

## About button settings

The contents of setting values vary depending on the setting,
but in addition to simple numbers and ON/OFF, one commonly used type is button settings.
These are used when configuring combinations of buttons.

Each button corresponds to the names in the table below,
and these names are listed singly or connected by "+" to list multiple buttons.
Uppercase and lowercase letters are not distinguished.

```
  ------------------------
  Button name | Button
  ------------------------
  Select      | Select button
  Start       | Start button
  Up          | D-pad up
  Right       | D-pad right
  Down        | D-pad down
  Left        | D-pad left
  LTrigger    | L button
  RTrigger    | R button
  Triangle    | △ button
  Circle      | ○ button
  Cross       | × button
  Square      | □ button
  HOME        | HOME button
  NOTE        | ♪ button
  SCREEN      | Brightness change button
  VolUp       | Volume + button
  VolDown     | Volume - button
  AnalogUp    | Analog stick upward direction
  AnalogRight | Analog stick rightward direction
  AnalogDown  | Analog stick downward direction
  AnalogLeft  | Analog stick leftward direction
  RPlayPause  | Remote control play/pause button
  RForward    | Remote control fast-forward button
  RBack       | Remote control rewind button
  RVolUp      | Remote control volume + button
  RVolDown    | Remote control volume - button
  ------------------------
```

For example, to set simultaneous pressing of the Start button and Select button,

```
  Start + Select
```

is written as shown above.
Also, when setting just a single button, for example only the ♪ button,

```
  NOTE
```

simply write only the name.

Incidentally, although it is unlikely anyone would do so,

```
  Left + Right
  Up + Down
  Up + Right + Down + Left
```

such settings are also possible.
However, normally the PSP directional buttons cannot press a direction and its opposite at the same time,
so these have no meaning.

Moreover, if such a setting is used as the menu launch button,
you will be unable to display the menu during that time, so please be careful.
MacroFire does not correct such impossible setting values.

## macrofire.ini search path

Normally, macrofire.ini is searched for in the same folder as macrofire.prx,
but as an exception, only when macrofire.prx is launched from internal flash memory,

```
ms0:/seplugins/macrofire.ini
```

is always searched for.

## How to switch the configuration file loaded at startup for each game

Write a section name with the game ID in macrofire.ini, and write the settings there.
For example, as follows:

```
  [ULJM05325]
  Startup = On
  MenuButtons = VolUp + VolDown
  ToggleButtons = NOTE
  StatusNotification = Off
  AnalogStickMovement = On
  AnalogStickDeadzone = 40
  AnalogStickSensitivity = 100
  AnalogStickOriginX = 127
  AnalogStickOriginY = 127
  ForcedLowMemoryMode = Off
  Remap = ms0:/macrofire/remap/analog_to_dpad.ini
  Rapidfire = ms0:/macrofire/rapidfire/SOSE.ini
  Macro1 = ms0:/macrofire/macro/SOSE/auto_creation_shippitsu.ini
  Macro2 = ms0:/macrofire/macro/SOSE/auto_creation_art.ini
```

By setting it this way,
these settings will be used only when launching the game with game ID ULJM-05325.

This game ID is displayed at the very top
when you display the MacroFire menu while the game is running.

The entries that can be written are the same as those in the [Default] section.

## Supplementary loading of configuration values

If not all required configuration values are written in the section to be loaded,
MacroFire supplements those values from lower-priority sections.
For example,

```
  [ULJM05325]
  Startup = On
  StatusNotification = On
```

If set like this, the many other settings such as analog stick settings
are supplemented in order from the following sections.

```
  [ULJM05325]
    ↓
  [GAME]
    ↓
  [Default]
```

For configuration values that never appear even up to the [Default] section,
so-called “missing settings,”
MacroFire uses internally held initial values.

## Section names and order searched for configuration value supplementation

XMB:
[VSH] -> [Default]

POPS:
[<Game ID (such as SLPS10000)>] -> [POPS] -> [Default]

GAME (UMD):
[<Game ID (such as ULJM10000)>] -> [GAME] -> [Default]

GAME (homebrew):
[<8-character ID (part of a hash value calculated from the homebrew executable file)>] -> [GAME] -> [Default]

## Settings

Introduces the configurable setting names, setting values, and their details.

## [Default] section

```
Startup
  Setting value: On | Off

  Sets whether to enable the MacroFire Engine at startup.
    OFF : Do not enable at startup.
    ON  : Enable at startup.

MenuButtons
  Setting value: Button setting

  Sets the default Buttons to launch the menu.
  See readme.txt for details.

ToggleButtons
  Setting value: Button setting

  Sets the default Buttons to toggle the engine state.
  See readme.txt for details.

StatusNotification
  Setting value: On | Off

  Sets the default Status notification.
  See readme.txt for details.

AnalogStickMovement
  Setting value: On | Off

  Sets the default Analog stick movement.
  See manual_analogsens.txt for details.

AnalogStickDeadzone
  Setting value: Numeric value from 0 to 182

  Sets the default Deadzone radius.
  See manual_analogsens.txt for details.

AnalogStickSensitivity
  Setting value: Numeric value from 0 to 200

  Sets the default Sensitivity.
  See manual_analogsens.txt for details.

AnalogStickOriginX
  Setting value: Numeric value from 0 to 255

  Sets the default Origin X-coordinate.
  See manual_analogsens.txt for details.

AnalogStickOriginY
  Setting value: Numeric value from 0 to 255

  Sets the default Origin Y-coordinate.
  See manual_analogsens.txt for details.

ForcedLowMemoryMode
  Setting value: On | Off

  Prohibits allocation of a frame buffer for menu display.
  Forces “Low Memory Mode,” which normally becomes enabled automatically when memory is low.
  The frame buffer is allocated from memory that should be safe to use, so in most cases there should be no problem even if this is Off,
  but it seems there are rare cases where some software freezes when displaying or exiting the menu,
  and in such cases setting this to On may resolve the issue.
  However, operability within the menu will be reduced.

Remap
  Setting value: File path (ms0:/...)

  Specifies the button remapping configuration file to be loaded at startup.
  Please specify the full path starting from “ms0:/”.

Rapidfire
  Setting value: File path (ms0:/...)

  Specifies the rapid-fire configuration file to be loaded at startup.
  Please specify the full path starting from “ms0:/”.

Macro1
  Setting value: File path (ms0:/...)

  Specifies the macro file to be loaded at startup.
  Please specify the full path starting from “ms0:/”.

  This setting value can be set in any number by increasing the number as Macro2, Macro3, ...
  However, the numbers must be consecutive.
  For example,
      Macro1 = ms0:/...
      Macro2 = ms0:/...
      Macro3 = ms0:/...
      Macro5 = ms0:/...
  If set like this,
  because Macro4 does not exist, MacroFire mistakenly recognizes that settings exist only up to Macro3 and Macro5 will not be loaded.
```

## [AlternativeButtons] section

```
Select
Start
Up
Right
Down
Left
Ltrigger
Rtrigger
Triangle
Circle
Cross
Square
Home
  Setting value: Button setting

  These are alternative button settings that function only within the MacroFire menu.
  Their primary purpose is to cover broken buttons.
  By making it possible to operate the menu with these settings, Remap settings can be performed.

  Set alternative buttons for the above buttons.
  If the setting value is empty, no alternative button is set, and the button corresponding to the button name is used as-is.

  For example, if you want to set an alternative button for the Start button
  due to reasons such as the Start button being broken and unresponsive,
  set only the Start entry to the combination of buttons you want to use as the alternative button.

    Start = LTrigger + RTrigger + Select
```
