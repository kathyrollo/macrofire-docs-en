MacroFire 3.2.9

## Remap settings

The operation method is slightly different from other settings.
First, this settings screen has two columns: a list column and a menu column.
The currently selected column is displayed with a red border.
Use the L/R buttons to switch columns.

The “Remapping to _________” shown at the bottom indicates
which button the currently selected entry is being remapped to.

## List column

Remap settings are listed here.
If no settings exist at all, the following is displayed:

```
  <Press TRIANGLE(△) to add a new remap>
```

Press the △ button to set which button to remap.
For example, let’s say you set the ○ button.
Then the following entry will appear in the list:

```
  ○
```

And at the bottom,

```
  Remapping to Disable
```

will be displayed.

This means that the ○ button is not assigned to anything,
effectively disabling the ○ button.

Next, press the ○ button to set the remapped destination button for this entry.
Suppose you set the × button.
Then the bottom display will change as follows:

```
  Remapping to ×
```

This indicates that the ○ button is being remapped to the × button.

This is the basic usage.
To delete an entry, place the cursor on the entry you want to delete and press the □ button.

## Menu column

Load
Loads remap settings from the memory stick.
This is not an additive load, so any existing settings will be discarded.

Save
Saves the current contents of the list column to the memory stick.

Clear
Deletes all remap settings.

## v2.x.x remap settings files

Cannot be loaded.
