MacroFire 3.2.9

## Rapidfire settings

You can set a rapid-fire mode for each of the following buttons.

```
○ button       (Circle)
× button       (Cross)
□ button       (Square)
△ button       (Triangle)
Directional Up     (Up)
Directional Right  (Right)
Directional Down   (Down)
Directional Left   (Left)
L button        (L-trig)
R button        (R-trig)
Start button    (START)
Select button   (SELECT)
```

There are five modes, each having the following meanings.

```
Normal: Normal operation mode.
        No rapid fire is performed; key input is passed through exactly as entered by the player.

Rapid: Rapid-fire mode.
       Rapid fire is performed only while this button is being held down.

Auto-Rapid: Automatic rapid-fire mode.
            Rapid fire is maintained at all times even if the button is not being pressed.

Hold: Not a rapid-fire mode, but a hold-down mode.
      Pressing a button set to this toggles between the pressed state and the released state.

Auto-Hold: Not a rapid-fire mode, but a hold-down mode.
           Keeps this button in a continuously pressed state.
```

## Wait control

The rapid-fire speed can be controlled to some extent using Release delay / Press delay.

Release delay refers to the time the button remains released,
and Press delay refers to the time the button remains pressed.

Increasing these times will gradually slow down the rapid-fire speed.
Due to the specifications, the rapid-fire speed only begins to decrease
once the delay exceeds the interval at which the game acquires pad data.
Since most games acquire pad data at the Vsync cycle,
changes in rapid-fire speed will probably begin to appear around 16ms or 17ms.

In games that acquire pad data at the Vsync cycle, 0ms, 5ms, and 10ms
will all result in the same rapid-fire speed.
However, at 18ms, 19ms, and 20ms, the rapid-fire speed will gradually decrease.

Some games appear not to recognize rapid fire that is too fast.
If buttons do not respond or become extremely sluggish even when rapid fire is set,
try setting both values to around 17–34ms.

## Save and load

In addition to button rapid-fire settings, the Wait control settings described above are also saved.
When you find Delay values that allow the fastest rapid fire for a particular game,
it may be a good idea to save them so you do not forget.
