## Edit macro

Edits the macro in main memory recorded by Start recording.
Each line is a command to be executed, and the following types exist.

```
Delay: Pauses execution.
       Keeps the immediately preceding button state for the specified time.
       The unit is ms (milliseconds); 1 second equals 1,000 milliseconds.
       The maximum value is 999,999,999ms (277 hours 46 minutes 39.999 seconds).

Buttons press: Presses buttons.
               Buttons are pressed by being added to the immediately preceding button state.
                 Buttons press: ×
                 Buttons press: ○
               results in both ○ and × being pressed in the final state.

Buttons release: Releases buttons.
                 As with Buttons press, the specified buttons are released from the preceding state.
                   Buttons press  : ○ △
                   Buttons press  : ×
                   Buttons release: △
                 results in both ○ and × being pressed in the final state.

Buttons change: Changes the button state.
                This command occurs when Buttons press and Buttons release happen at the same time,
                and it completely changes the button state regardless of the preceding state.
                  Buttons press  : ○ △
                  Buttons press  : ×
                  Buttons release: △
                  Buttons change : □
                results in only the □ button being pressed in the final state.

Analog move: Tilts the analog stick.
             With the top-left as (x,y) = (0,0), moves the analog stick to an arbitrary position.

Rapidfire start: Starts rapid fire.
                 Sets the button to be rapid-fired in the same way as Buttons press.
                 PD/RD refers to Press delay/Release delay; for details, see manual_rapidfire.txt.

Rapidfire stop: Stops rapid fire.
```

In editing, you can change the values of these commands,
and insert/delete the commands themselves.

All commands except Delay are executed one per frame.
For example,
Buttons press: ○ ×
presses the buttons completely simultaneously, whereas
Buttons press: ○
Buttons press: ×
inputs the buttons sequentially with a one-frame delay.
Therefore,
Buttons press: ○
Buttons release: ○
when repeated infinitely, behaves like rapid pressing of the ○ button.

However, Delay is handled differently:
Delay: 500ms
and
Delay: 200ms
Delay: 300ms
both have exactly the same meaning and wait for the same total amount of time.

Also, even if you try to delete all macros using Delete, they cannot be completely removed.
Specifically, Delay 0 ms will always remain.
To completely erase a macro, execute Clear from the macro main menu.

## v2.x.x macro files

Cannot be loaded.
