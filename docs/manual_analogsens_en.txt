MacroFire 3.2.9

## Analog stick sensitivity adjustment

Adjusts the sensitivity of the analog stick.
It also affects analog stick input during macro recording.

Also, the default values of these settings can be changed via macrofire.ini.

Analog stick movement
Toggles analog stick input.
When set to OFF, all input from the analog stick is discarded and it always returns the origin.

Deadzone radius
Specifies the radius from the origin within which input values are discarded.
If the analog stick is within this circle, it is always corrected to the origin.

Sensitivity
Sets the sensitivity.
The actual movement distance is multiplied by the ratio set here.

Origin X-coordinate
Specifies the X coordinate to be used as the origin.
Normally there is no need to change it from 127.
Even if the stick is loose and does not settle at the center,
widening the Deadzone is thought to produce better results than adjusting this.

Origin Y-coordinate
Specifies the Y coordinate to be used as the origin.
Normally there is no need to change it from 127.
Even if the stick is loose and does not settle at the center,
widening the Deadzone is thought to produce better results than adjusting this.

## About the diagram

The overlapping square and circle displayed on the right side of the menu
represent the movable range of the analog stick, the effective range under the current settings,
and the current position and the adjusted position.

The outermost white square represents the movable range of the analog stick.
The red circle inside it represents the Deadzone.
Analog stick movement within this circle is treated as if it did not exist from the game’s perspective.

The red dot represents the current position of the analog stick.
The white dot represents the position of the analog stick after adjustment by the Deadzone and Sensitivity,
that is, the position actually passed to the game.
