2011/09/07 - 3.2.9

* Fixed an issue where it did not work in POPS on 6.39/6.60 PRO-B9.

2011/08/20 - 3.2.8

* Fixed an issue where selecting Load on Homebrew would cause a freeze.

2011/08/20 - 3.2.7

* Fixed an issue where MacroFire did not start in POPS and Homebrew.

2011/07/10 - 3.2.6

* Fixed an issue where the game ID could not be obtained correctly in some games.

2010/07/31 - 3.2.5

* Fixed an issue where the RapidfireStart setting value was not correctly restored when loading a macro file.

2010/05/21 - 3.2.4

* Fixed an issue in the analog stick tuning feature where changing the sensitivity even by 1% from 100%
  caused movement upward from the center to be input as downward, and movement leftward to be input as rightward.

2010/05/18 - 3.2.3

* Fixed an issue where START/SELECT set in macro Buttons press were ignored during playback.

2010/05/05 - 3.2.2

* Fixed an issue where setting values could not be read correctly from macrofire.ini.

2010/05/02 - 3.2.1

* Reduced the memory size used for menu display by half by lowering the color depth to 16-bit when displaying the menu.

* Fixed numerous processes that had a risk of causing MacroFire to freeze.
  This refers strictly to “MacroFire freezing,” and situations where freezing is caused “by MacroFire” cannot be avoided.

* Restored the startup wait time that had once been removed in 3.1.0.

* The “Loaded” display was abolished.
  This is because macrofire.ini setting values were changed to be read step by step from multiple sections.
  See manual_ini.txt for details.

2010/03/15 - 3.2.0

* Enabled reassignment and macro registration for the system HOME button and volume buttons by using a new hooking method.
  These fully perform their original button roles.
  For compatibility with other plugins, see “Startup order” in readme.txt.

* Raised the upper limit of analog stick sensitivity from 200% to 400%.

* Fixed an issue where the macro editor was not functioning properly and was only viewable.

* Fixed an issue in the numeric input dialog where lower digits could not be set properly if the highest digit was at the maximum value.
  For example, in a numeric dialog with a maximum value of 255, if the hundreds digit was set to 2,
  the ones digit could only be set from 0 to 5.
  As a result, it was not possible to set values such as 206, 217, 228, 239, where the ones digit is 6 or higher.

* Fixed an issue where setting remote control buttons for Buttons to toggle the engine state did not work.

* Modified macro recording so that buttons pressed to launch the menu are not recorded at the end.

* “MacroFire is not working perfectly.” is no longer displayed.

2010/03/07 - 3.1.0

* Experimentally removed the startup wait time.

* Removed “-” from UMD game IDs. (Example: ULJM-00001 -> ULJM00001)

* Made it possible to obtain game IDs for PS1 games.

* When launching Homebrew, now calculates a hash value from the executable file
  and uses it as the game ID.
  (This ID is 8 characters long and consists only of the characters “0123456789ABCDEF”.)

* Removed the [Main] and [AnalogStick] sections from macrofire.ini,
  and moved all their settings to the [Default] section.
  All entries in the [Default] section can also be applied to game ID sections.

* Abolished the macrofire.ini setting value “UseVolatileMemory”.

* Renamed the macrofire.ini setting value “UseGraphicsMemory” to “ForcedLowMemoryMode”.
  Note that the meaning of the setting value is the exact opposite.

* Made it possible to register macros as long as memory allows by dynamically allocating macro storage.

* In addition to the previous automatic detection, the dialog box for button settings
  now also allows button selection as used in older versions.

* Renamed Engine status notification to Status notification.

* When Status notification is set to ON, in addition to displaying engine state changes,
  notifications are also displayed when macros are executed or stopped via hotkeys.

2010/01/22 - 3.0.13

* Changed rapid-fire waiting time settings to operate more flexibly.
  See manual_rapidfire.txt for details.

* Added a confirmation message when clearing macros.

* Fixed an issue where MacroFire was recognized as GAME instead of POPS
  when it started on the POPS version selection screen of popsloader.

* Attempted to reduce the plugin file size.
  There was not much effect.

2009/11/30 - 3.0.12

* Fixed an issue where MacroFire did not function at all in POPS.

2009/11/15 - 3.0.11

* Fixed an issue where some games such as Monster Hunter returned 800200D9 and would not start.
  Test code had been left in……

2009/11/13 - 3.0.10

* Fixed an issue where Auto-Rapid did not function,
  even though Auto-Rapid and Auto-Hold are supposed to temporarily suspend their behavior
  while actual PSP buttons are being pressed.

* Modified the MacroFire menu to automatically swap the ○/× buttons (O/X button swap)
  according to the PSP registry.

2009/09/17 - 3.0.9

* Fixed an issue where the game would stop when switching Status notification from ON to OFF.

2009/09/14 - 3.0.8 (missing number)

* Fixed an issue where Status notification could not be disabled once it was enabled.

* Fixed an issue where the display became incorrect
  when Status notification was performed after opening the menu at least once.

* Fixed an issue where Remap settings (button reassignment)
  did not work even when the analog stick was set as the reassignment target.

* Fixed an issue where the screen became severely corrupted
  when opening or closing the menu while POPS was running.

* Tentatively fixed an issue where, when displaying the menu while running an older POPS version via PopsLoader,
  the sound that had just been emitted would continue playing throughout menu display.

* When available free memory for menu display was extremely low,
  added a display of <Low Memory Mode> at the top of the menu.
  This display method itself existed before, but from this version it explicitly indicates that the mode is active.

* Fixed an issue where analog stick directions were not displayed properly
  when configuring button settings in Low Memory Mode,
  making it appear as though they were not set.

2009/09/03 - 3.0.7

* Increased the startup wait time by 2 seconds.

* Fixed an issue where notifications displayed by Status Notification flickered violently.

* Fixed an issue where menu display became incorrect when available memory was low.

* Fixed missing Japanese localization.

2009/09/01 - 3.0.6

* Stopped using compressed PRX files, as they seemed to consume unnecessary resources during load due to decompression.

* Prevented an issue where leaving the menu open for a certain period caused the LCD to remain turned off.

* Adjusted displayed strings.

2009/08/20 - 3.0.5

* Fixed behavior so that when launched from internal flash memory,
  it searches for ms0:/seplugins/macrofire.ini.

* Made it so that when loading macrofire.ini fails for any reason,
  “Loaded: Built-in” is displayed at the top of the menu.

* Moved macrofire.ini’s UseVolatileMemory from the [Menu] section to the [Default] section.
  All entries in the [Default] section can also be applied to game ID sections.

* Added UseGraphicsMemory to macrofire.ini.
  Despite allocating memory from a location where it should be safe, freezes sometimes occurred.
  When this option is set to Off, the frame buffer is not allocated and it runs in low-memory mode.
  However, menu operability worsens.

* Fixed an issue where analog stick settings were not initialized correctly.
  When macrofire.ini could not be loaded, everything was being initialized to 0.

* Fixed an issue where, when MacroFire displayed its menu in PSPFiler and similar tools,
  the screen could no longer be updated afterward.
  The cause was failure to properly restore the frame buffer address after menu display,
  and depending on the game, this could cause freezing after closing the menu.

* Fixed remaining issues in the process of determining which INI file section to load, which had already been partially fixed in 3.0.4.

* Fixed an issue where Auto-Hold could not be read
  when loading rapid-fire settings from a file.

* Fixed an issue where rapid-fire mode could not be configured
  only when a configuration file was set in the Rapidfire entry of macrofire.ini for automatic loading.

2009/08/14 - 3.0.4

* Reduced the size of the MacroFire core by using pspsysclib, which had not been used since BETA3.
  This may have reduced the likelihood of issues during game loading.

* Fixed an issue where, if a loaded configuration file contained remote control buttons,
  they were not applied, and the system mistakenly believed buttons were set,
  resulting in impossible setting values.

* Fixed an issue where loading was performed before determining the section name
  of the INI file to be loaded.

* Fixed an issue where reading the final setting value failed
  if macrofire.ini did not end with a newline.

2009/08/12 - 3.0.3

* Adjusted memory handling to reduce fragmentation.

* Changed macro menu behavior so that when starting macro execution or real-time recording,
  the current MacroFire Engine state is checked.
  If it is OFF, a message is displayed and the menu returns. (Same behavior as v2.4.1 and earlier)

* When a macro has a name, it is now used as the default file name when saving the macro.

* Enabled setting the HOME button in the following items.
  However, there are many restrictions, so see the “HOME button restrictions” section in readme.txt.
  Menu launch button
  Engine state toggle button
  Button reassignment settings
  Macro hotkeys
  Macro Buttons press / Buttons release / Buttons change / Rapidfire start

* Fixed an issue where selecting Save/Load and reading the file system caused a freeze.
  The cause was miscounting entries when hidden-attribute files were present in the loaded folder.

* Fixed an issue where saving a macro produced a corrupted file.

* Fixed issues that occurred when loading a macro file
  that either lacked a [Macro] section or had no entries in that section.

* Fixed an issue where setting macro repeat count to 2 or higher caused infinite repetition.

* Fixed an issue where, when the Delay command appeared two or more times consecutively in a macro,
  the waiting time from the second occurrence onward became almost zero.
  This bug also existed in version 2.x.

* Fixed an issue where macro loops could be slightly misaligned compared to the recorded timing.

* Fixed an issue where setting the same hotkey for two or more macros
  caused all of them to execute simultaneously.

2009/08/11 - 3.0.2

* Changed macrofire.ini to be searched for in the folder where macrofire.prx exists.
  Since it is no longer hardcoded to ms0:/seplugins,
  even if macrofire.prx is moved to a location other than seplugins,
  macrofire.ini will no longer be created only in ms0:/seplugins.

* Fixed an issue where buttons set in macrofire.ini’s ToggleButtons
  were always recognized as NOTE.

* Fixed an issue where the macro Delay command waited longer than the configured wait time.

2009/08/09 - 3.0.1

* When another program hooks the same API that MacroFire attempts to hook, as with PSP-HUD,
  and MacroFire seems unable to override it,
  a message “MacroFire is not working perfectly.” is now displayed on the menu screen.
  Even if this message is displayed, it may still work correctly in some cases,
  but in most cases it is safe to assume it will not work.

2009/08/08 - 3.0.0

* Rewrote almost all of the code.

* Changed many data items previously held as static variables
  to be allocated from the heap when needed.
  Memory usage while the menu is displayed increased,
  but memory usage when it is not displayed decreased.
  This may have reduced the likelihood of interfering with games.

* Changed startup behavior to wait up to about 10 seconds before starting.
  This may have reduced the likelihood of issues during game loading.

* Made minor font adjustments.

* Completely revamped dialogs.
  Note that the dialog for setting button combinations has been significantly changed.

* Changed basic menu operations.
  This was unavoidable in order to display the menu in multiple columns.
  Previously, options and values were changed using left/right on the D-pad,
  but these operations are now performed with the ○ and □ buttons.
  (Operation returned to something similar to pre-BETA3 behavior.)

* Menu items that are unusable or meaningless at that time
  are now grayed out (not selectable).

* Added support for remote control buttons.

* Made it possible to display a message on the screen when toggling the MacroFire Engine ON/OFF.

* Set the default values of Press delay / Release delay in rapid-fire settings to 0.
  Previously, setting them to 0 caused strange behavior in POPS,
  but this appears to have been a MacroFire issue rather than a game-side limitation.
  It is unclear exactly how it was resolved, but rapid-fire now works even with 0.

* Made it possible to name macros.
  Focus the macro slot selection item and press the △ button to set the name.

* Made it possible to set macro repeat counts as explicit numbers.

* When saving macros, now saves the name, hotkey, and repeat count as information.

* Enabled real-time appending to macros.

* Modified real-time macro recording so that recording does not start
  until some recordable button is pressed.
  There is no longer a need to delete unnecessary Delay at the beginning of already recorded macros.

* Made it possible to change the following configuration files loaded at startup per game ID:
  Button reassignment settings
  Rapid-fire settings
  Macros 1–10
  Along with this change, the “Remap,” “Rapidfire,” and “Macro” sections were abolished.
  See manual_ini.txt for details.

* Changed configuration file loading to check the signature at an early stage.
  Previously, accidentally loading a huge file would cause it to wait indefinitely
  until memory was exhausted or loading completed,
  but now an error is returned immediately.

* Accelerated file loading and saving.

2009/01/05 - 2.4.1

* Added new sections “AlternativeButtons,” “Remap,” “Rapidfire,” and “Macro” to macrofire.ini.
  See manual_ini.txt for details.

* Added a new Analog stick movement option to the analog stick tuning menu.
  When set to OFF, analog stick input can be disabled.

* Fixed an error in the calculation formula used for Deadzone detection
  in analog stick tuning.
  A wider range than specified had been incorrectly disabled.

* Along with the formula correction, raised the upper limit of Deadzone radius
  in analog stick tuning to 182.

* Added diagrams to visually understand
  the analog stick movable range, disabled range,
  current position, and adjusted position.

2008/12/21 - 2.4.0

* Implemented button reassignment functionality.

* Changed configuration files to be case-insensitive for alphabet letters.

* Changed the macro file format.
  Macros from v2.3.4 and earlier can no longer be loaded.

2008/11/27 - 2.3.4

* Switched hooking back to a custom implementation after using the M33 SDK in v2.3.2.
  The reasoning is unclear, but this appears to have eliminated conflicts with PSP-HUD.

* Modified behavior to obtain the execution mode of threads
  that triggered system call exceptions,
  returning more accurate button states.

* Fixed an issue where the menu could no longer be closed with the HOME button.

2008/10/30 - 2.3.3

* When insufficient memory prevented allocating a frame buffer,
  enabled menu display using the current screen.
  In this case, the screen may flicker or some messages may not be displayed,
  but it is better than being unable to display the menu.

* Fixed an issue where attempting Save/Load while the memory stick access lamp was blinking
  caused the system to become unresponsive.
  However, in this state, due to PSP specifications(?),
  the memory stick cannot be accessed,
  so a message indicating access failure is displayed.

* Fixed an issue where AnalogUp / AnalogRight / AnalogDown / AnalogLeft
  did not work in the settings for
  “Buttons to launch the menu” and “Buttons to toggle the engine state”.

* Fixed an issue where, in macro “Buttons to run the macro,”
  the analog stick and some buttons were not judged correctly.

2008/10/22 - 2.3.2

* Changed hooking to use the M33 SDK.

* Enabled operation in VSH.
  However, for now, rapid-fire and macros are restricted
  in the “Internet Browser”,
  effectively limiting functionality to analog stick sensitivity adjustment only.
  This measure was taken due to concerns that these features
  could be used for attack-like behavior against other sites.
  In the future, restrictions may be relaxed while implementing countermeasures.

* Fixed an issue where the macro Delay command waited one frame (about 18 ms)
  longer than the configured wait time.
  This bug likely exists in all past versions.

2008/10/20 - 2.3.1

* Fixed an issue where recording analog stick movement in macro recording
  inserted unnecessary “Buttons press / Buttons release”
  before and after “Analog move”.

* Fixed an issue where attempting to change values with left/right on the D-pad
  caused values to become 0
  in all items of the analog stick tuning feature.

2008/10/19 - 2.3.0

* Implemented a feature to hold multiple macros
  and execute them with arbitrary configured buttons
  without displaying the menu.

* Fixed behavior so that the frame buffer is allocated from memory
  that can be used safely.
  This may have made it possible to correctly display the menu
  even in software that previously froze when opening or closing the menu.

* Fixed an issue where calling the menu
  while the game had not set up the screen or frame buffer
  caused a freeze.

2008/09/27 - 2.2.2

* Fixed an issue where macro and rapid-fire configuration file save/load
  could not handle files located deeper than the root folder (ms0:/).

2008/09/27 - 2.2.1

* Fixed an issue where, during recording of Buttons press / Buttons release,
  if buttons to press/release were added at intervals so short
  that no Delay was inserted between them,
  the first event disappeared and only one button was recorded as a result.

* Fixed a recurrence of a bug from 2.0.0
  where starting macro recording while buttons were already pressed
  caused a freeze immediately upon returning to the game.

2008/09/23 - 2.2.0

* Added a new mode “HOLD” to Rapidfire settings.
  Unlike AUTO-HOLD, pressing the button toggles
  between pressed and not pressed states.

* Fixed an issue where Buttons release was not recorded at all
  when recording macros.

2008/08/29 - 2.1.0

* Added Rapidfire Start / Rapidfire stop to macro commands.

* Changed Press delay / Release delay in rapid-fire settings
  to be specified in ms (milliseconds).
  However, essentially nothing has changed,
  so see manual_rapidfire.txt.

* Modified AUTO-RAPID and AUTO-HOLD so that
  if actual PSP buttons are pressed, their operation is temporarily stopped.
  If a button set to AUTO-RAPID is pressed, rapid-fire stops,
  and if a button set to AUTO-HOLD is pressed, the held state is released.

* Renamed two home menu items.
  "MacroFire toggle buttons"          -> "Buttons to toggle the engine state"
  "Analog stick sensitivity settings" -> "Tuning the analog stick sensitivity"

* Added “Buttons to launch the menu” to the home menu.
  The menu launch button can now be changed from the menu.
  However, it is not saved, so to change the default value,
  macrofire.ini must still be edited as before.

* Enabled setting the analog stick as the menu launch button
  and engine state toggle button.
  Arbitrary coordinates cannot be specified,
  but up/down/left/right of the analog stick can be set.

* Added the following to the INI file “button definitions (see pref_manual.txt)”:
  ANALOGUP ANALOGRIGHT ANALOGDOWN ANALOGLEFT

* Fixed an issue where, after executing “(old) MacroFire toggle buttons” at least once,
  executing ButtonsPress / ButtonsRelease / ButtonsChange in the macro editor
  caused buttons that should not be configurable, such as volume buttons, to appear.

2008/08/20 - 2.0.1

* Slightly improved speed by using the DMA controller via sceDmacMemcpy()
  for background transfer.

* Improved speed by transferring display/draw buffers and background within VRAM.
  By placing them in VRAM, it became possible to display the menu
  even when extended kernel memory could not be allocated.

* Changed extended kernel memory allocation to use
  scePowerVolatileMemTryLock() / scePowerVolatileMemUnlock().
  Previously, mysterious freezes occurred on Unlock,
  but this time it worked without particular issues.
  Perhaps something had been done incorrectly before……

* Made key repeat behavior more natural.
  Previously, when “slow key repeat” occurred twice in succession,
  it switched to “fast key repeat” from the third time,
  but now it switches to “fast key repeat” from the second occurrence.

* Fixed a memory leak in the file selection dialog.
  After opening the dialog, canceling with the × button
  consumed 512 bytes of memory each time.

2008/08/16 - 2.0.0

* Implemented analog stick sensitivity adjustment functionality.

* Changed behavior so that key repeat occurs
  in various situations such as D-pad operation on the menu screen
  and confirmation buttons during file name input.
  Holding down the D-pad causes the cursor to keep moving.

* Changed screen rendering to a double-buffering method.
  This enabled smooth screen updates and transparency via alpha blending.
  In exchange, basic memory usage and speed were somewhat sacrificed.
  A notable example is that the menu cannot be displayed
  on game save/load screens because memory cannot be allocated.
  This is because buffers are allocated from kernel memory,
  and there is currently no solution.
  (This was solved by placing them in VRAM.)

* Changed the format of basic configuration files,
  rapid-fire configuration files, and macro files to INI format.
  This made direct editing with a text editor easier.

* Changed numeric input items so that pressing left/right
  directly decreases/increases the value.

* Abolished the 3-second countdown at the start of macro recording.
  This was a barrier to prevent menu-side operations
  from affecting the game side,
  but from this version onward,
  a short mandatory pause is applied when exiting the menu,
  making the countdown unnecessary.

* Removed “Create macro” from the macro menu.
  When “Edit macro” is executed while the macro is cleared,
  it is created automatically.

* Significantly changed how the macro editor is operated.
  Menu display was minimized,
  and various actions are performed depending on the buttons pressed.

* Removed “Analog neutral” from macro commands.
  Use Analog move 128,128 instead.

* Fixed an issue where deleting the first command
  when only two command lines remained
  caused a freeze in the macro editor.

* Fixed an issue where starting macro recording
  while holding down buttons already being recorded,
  or while buttons with AUTO-HOLD set via rapid-fire settings existed,
  caused a freeze immediately upon returning to the game.

2008/07/24 - 1.2.0

* Implemented a feature to read some basic settings
  from a file as default settings.

* Fixed an issue where attempting to load macro or rapid-fire configuration files
  without a signature or with non-existent file names
  caused a memory leak.

2008/07/19 - 1.1.3

* Fixed an issue where setting MacroFire toggle buttons
  prevented the menu from being displayed
  until the game was restarted.

2008/07/16 - 1.1.2

* Fixed an issue when multiple buttons were set
  for MacroFire toggle buttons.
  When configured to toggle using a combination of multiple buttons,
  toggling was supposed to occur only when all of those buttons were pressed,
  but in reality, toggling occurred when any one of the configured buttons was pressed.

2008/07/12 - 1.1.1

* Fixed an issue where AUTO-HOLD did not function
  when Release Delay was 1 or higher
  in Rapidfire settings.

* Fixed issues where Release Delay / Pressed Delay
  behaved incorrectly in Rapidfire settings.

* Modified sceCtrl*Latch-related functions
  to return more normal values.

2008/07/11 - 1.1.0

* Implemented saving and loading of rapid-fire settings.

* Fixed reduced rapid-fire speed.

* Fixed an issue where, in the macro editor,
  performing operations on the final remaining “Delay 0 ms”
  after deleting everything
  caused a freeze.

* Fixed an issue where deleting the first macro
  prevented subsequent macros from being deleted.

* Changed the initial values of Released delay and Pressed delay
  in Rapidfire settings to 2.

* Made saved macro files and rapid-fire configuration files
  write a signature.

2008/07/08 - 1.0.0

* Implemented saving and loading of macros.

* Fixed an issue where performing Edit data on Buttons change
  during macro editing resulted in nothing happening.

* Changed focus movement and scrolling behavior
  in menus and the macro editor.

* Modified sceCtrl*Latch functions
  to return somewhat normal values.
  This appears to have enabled some degree of operation
  even in POPS (PS1 emulator).

* Added Released delay and Pressed delay
  to the Rapidfire settings menu.
  This made it possible to control rapid-fire intervals to some extent.

2008/05/18 - BETA5

* Added the Create macro command to the macro menu.
  This allows creation of basic macro data
  without recording a macro.

* Fixed an issue where attempting to insert a new command
  before the first command during macro editing
  (executing Insert before on macro command number 001)
  caused a freeze.

* Changed behavior when turning MacroFire Engine OFF
  while a macro was running.
  Previously, if it was turned OFF during execution
  and then turned ON again without executing Stop macro,
  the macro would resume from the command where it stopped,
  i.e., from the middle.
  Since this is rarely useful,
  it was changed to always restart from the beginning.
  This allows pseudo-fast ON/OFF of macros
  using MacroFire Toggle Buttons.

2008/05/09 - BETA4

* Changed basic menu operations.
  Previously, options were changed with the ○ button,
  but now switching with left/right on the D-pad is the basic method,
  and the ○ button is used for confirming items and input.

* Made it possible to operate MacroFire Engine in-game
  without displaying the menu.

* Added an option to record analog stick movement in macros.

2008/05/05 - BETA3

* Changed the C standard library from lightweight sysclib to newlib.
  The file size increased significantly.
  The impact is unknown.

* Fixed an issue where the pause time editing screen
  in the macro editing feature was corrupted.

* Fixed an issue where setting a large pause time
  in macro editing caused it to be displayed as a negative value.

* Changed the unit of pause time
  from microseconds to milliseconds.
  As a result, excluding 0, the minimum and maximum wait times are as follows.
  Minimum 1 ms = 0.001 seconds
  Maximum 999,999,999 ms = 277 hours 46 minutes 39.999 seconds

* Made it so that the current value
  is set as the initial value when editing.

* Tentatively fixed an issue where,
  when returning to the game after leaving the menu open for a certain period,
  the LCD (screen) power remained off.
  This is not guaranteed,
  so if the screen is still off,
  try pressing the brightness change button.

* Tried tightening character spacing.

2008/04/25 - BETA2

* Implemented macro editing functionality.

* Fixed an issue where,
  if the final command was a pause when recording a macro,
  the pause time was always recorded as 0.
  Now the pause time is recorded correctly
  even if the last command is a pause.

* Changed the comparison basis for macro pause time
  from frame count to time in microseconds.
  This allows correct pausing
  even in homebrew that does not wait for vertical sync.

* Fixed flickering of some text on the menu screen.

* Changed the display of some buttons to symbols.

* Fixed (or so it seemed) an issue where,
  if buttons were held down during the countdown at the start of macro recording,
  the game froze immediately upon returning.
  (This was just a misunderstanding—it was not fixed!!)

2008/04/19 - BETA

* Public release
